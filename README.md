# Stepper Motor of Fortune
![](https://lambda.sx/jxz.jpg)
Wheel of fortune powered by a stepper motor. The user makes a statement and then presses the button and then gets an answer. When the button was pressed, the motor (with an arrow attached) spinned and randomly stops on the answer. 

The code to control the stepper motor function was flash onto microcontroller PIC16F690. P-Channel Power MOSFET IRFD9123 was so there enough power to turn the motor.
